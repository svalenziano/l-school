'''
Write some code that converts modern decimal numbers into their Roman number equivalents.

 - I = 1
 - V = 5
 - X = 10
 - L = 50
 - C = 100
 - D = 500
 - M = 1000

 - Placing any smaller number in front of any larger number indicates subtraction
    - For example, IV means 4, XL means 50, XC means 90, CD means 400

Let's do some tests:
2024 = MMXXIV
