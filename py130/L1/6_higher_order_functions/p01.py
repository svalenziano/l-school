'''
Write a select function that mimics the built-in filter function. Your select function should take two arguments: a callback function and an iterable object. It should return a list of all the elements of the iterable for which the callback function returns a truthy value. It should not include any elements for which the callback returns a falsy value.

Start by writing a function that doesn't use any comprehensions. Once your code works, refactor it to use a comprehension.

You can use the following examples to test your code:

'''





numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
colors = {'red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green',
          'blue', 'indigo', 'violet'}

odd_numbers = select(lambda number: number % 2 != 0, numbers)
print(odd_numbers)            # [1, 3, 5]

large_numbers = select(lambda number: number >= 10, numbers)
print(large_numbers)          # []

small_numbers = select(lambda number: number < 10, numbers)
print(small_numbers)          # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

short_color_names = select(lambda color: len(color) <= 5, colors)
print(short_color_names)      # ['blue', 'red', 'green']
# The order of the colors may vary, but should include the
# indicated colors.
