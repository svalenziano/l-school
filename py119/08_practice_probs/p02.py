RESULT = ðŸŸ¡ Fine in 14 mins.
          Had some trouble with start and stop indexes for the `sublists_of_5` comprehension.
          This stuff is still tricky!
          Writing my own test cases probably would have helped!

P
    intput = list of ints
    output = integer if 5 elements or more
             None if fewer than 5 elements
             Min sum of 5 consecutive nums in the list
E

D
    lst of lists?
A
    if fewer than 5, return None
    otherwise
        create list of all sublists of length 5
        create list of sums (of all sublists)
        return minimum sum
