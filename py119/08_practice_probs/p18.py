RESULT = ðŸŸ¢ 15 MINS, PRETTY EASY!  
                1) I examined the test cases in the REPL, which
                informed my data structure and algorithm.
                2) I kept my algorithm high level
                
P
    INPUT = list of ints
    OUTPUT = integer = index N
                Sum of nums greater than index N is equal to sum of
                nums less than index N
    REQ
        EX
            Multiple answers? return smallest value
            Sum of nums left of index 0 is 0.
            Sum of nums right of last index is also 0.
        IMPL
            Don't include the value at the index in any calcs.

    print(equal_sum_index([1, 2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 2]) == 3)
        sum([1,2,4]) == sum([2,3,2])
        Num at index 3 (in this case: 4) is omitted/ignored
D
    2 lists?
A

    - for each possible `split_indexes`, create tuple containing 2 lists and an index:
        (left_list, right_list, idx)
    - working left to right, determine which, if any of those combos results in 
        equality between the sums of the lists
    - if yes, return the index
    - if not, return -1
