        Reqs
            Prime # = number with whose only divisors are one and itself
        Alg
            Set comprehension to determine multiples other than one and num:
                divisor
                for every divisor btw 2 and num - 1 (skip 1 and num)
                if modulo num % divisor == 0 (divides evenly)
            return True if the set is empty
            otherwise, return False

    [NEAREST PRIME]
        INPUT = num
        output = nearest prime # (greater than num)
        Alg
            while number isn't prime (see helper above)
            increment num
        

    [MAIN FUNC]
        Get sum of ints
