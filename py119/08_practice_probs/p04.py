         I had a LOT of trouble with return_list_of_pairs.  
         My final answer was pretty dirty.
         I fundamentally misunderstood WHAT I WAS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH: every
         combo of 2 numbers possible.  Definitely need to revisit.

P
    INPUT = list of ints
    OUTPUT = tuple of 2 nums that are closest together in value
    REQS
        ex: 
            if there are mult pairs that occur equally as close, return 
            the pair that occurs first
        impl
            occurs first = INDEX OF 1ST ELEMENT IS LOWEST

E
D
    - list of diffs?
A

    return_list_of_pairs [HELPER]
        - INIT empy list
        - for each `first_idx` (0 to length minus one)
            - for each `second_idx` btw `first_idx + 1` and len(lst)
                - append lst[first idx: second idx]
        - return list


    [MAIN FUNC]
        - [HELPER] create list of number pairs
        - sort the pairs by `return_diff`
        - return the pair with the lowest sum
