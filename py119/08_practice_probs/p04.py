         I had a LOT of trouble with return_list_of_pairs.  
         My final answer was pretty dirty.
         I fundamentally misunderstood WHAT I WAS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH: every
         combo of 2 numbers possible.  Definitely need to revisit.

P
    INPUT = list of ints
    OUTPUT = tuple of 2 nums that are closest together in value
    REQS
        ex: 
            if there are mult pairs that occur equally as close, return 
            the pair that occurs first
        impl
            occurs first = INDEX OF 1ST ELEMENT IS LOWEST

E
D
    - list of diffs?
A

    return_list_of_pairs [HELPER]
        - for end_index (range(1, len(lst)))
            - for start index in range(0, len(lst) - 1)
                - if end doesn't equal start
                    -append

    [MAIN FUNC]
        - [HELPER] create list of number pairs
        - sort the pairs by `return_diff`
        - return the pair with the lowest sum
