  <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> from a <i>terrific</i> class I'm taking at <a href="http://www.launchschool.com">Launch School</a>. I'm learning a lot! Why don't you join me?
  </p>
  <p class="deemphasize">
    There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML & CSS. When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color than the first - the "class" attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.  
  </p>
  <p class="deemphasize" id="final">
    This is the final paragraph. It also uses the `class` attribute as well as an `id` attribute. We'll use some CSS and the `id` attribute to underline the entire paragraph.
