  SCREEN FLICKERING? The display flickers when run in the Windows terminal using Windows WSL2/Ubuntu, however it works fine in VSCode.  Not yet tested on MacOS.

  IF YOU GET LOST OR BORED:
  Enter 'h' anytime to get help.
  Enter 'q' anytime to quit.

  Press 'Enter' to start playing! 🙌

  Oh no, you're already having trouble?
  How about you just press 'Enter' right now and ask for help using 'h' later?
