  stack = list of values that grows and shrinks dynamically
    - May be implemented as an array with 2 methods: pop and push
  
  stack-and-register language = language that uses a stack of values
    - each operation operates on the register (the current value)
    - the register is not part of the stack
    - if an operation requires two values, it uses 1) the register value and 2) the value popped off the top of the stack
