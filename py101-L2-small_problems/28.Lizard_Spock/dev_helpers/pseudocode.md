... The problem with v1 is that determine_winner() has multiple side-effects.  
... It must update the score, but it must also **return** the winner
... How to resolve?
... 1) I could print the winner (instead of returning it) at the same time I update the dict
... This technically breaks the rule of 'return a useful value or have a side effect but not both' ðŸ˜Ÿ
... 2) One function could return the winner, and another could print and update the score
... However, this method is a little shaky because it relies on passing arguments with precision ðŸ˜Ÿ
... 3) One function updates the score and also the last winner??
... last_winner is a variable
... I think this is the easiest to understand, and also allows for future addition 
... of > 2 player functionality?
